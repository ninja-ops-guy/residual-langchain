## 1.0.0 (tag intent: `v1.0.0`)

No git-tag creation tool was available to the authoring agent; tag intent is
recorded here: `v1.0.0` on the commit landing this file on the default branch.

- `ResidualCallbackHandler` + `AsyncResidualCallbackHandler` for LangChain.
- Verified against langchain-core 1.6.3 in the authoring sandbox
  (8 framework integration tests).
- Passes ADAPTERS-CONFORMANCE 1.0.0 via tests/test_conformance_binding.py
  (vendored suite SHA-256 b8e14c9babc0eb4c7e07b04768afdda6e49c7a404e6e4ba1fc4f700f276b290e).
- Mutation-verified: gate-swallowing handler mutant is detected by the
  conformance suite (tests/test_conformance_binding.py::TestMutantRejected).
